### Florin Events App
The Florin Events App is a web application that allows users to create events, view other people's events, and declare interest in attending events. Users can view events by category and search for events using the search bar. The application was created to help a struggling county council that was struggling with funding issues. The project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL and consists of both a frontend and a backend.

### Usage
Once the application is installed, users can register as a user, create events, view other people's events, and declare interest in attending events. Users can also view events by category and search for events using the search bar.
